# Overview

In this tutorial I will show you how to deploy a static site on AWS via an S3 bucket. This is the process I followed to deploy this very blog.

# Prerequisites.

1. AWS Account.
2. Domain in Route53 *This is optional. Only needed if you want to serve the site from a custom domain.
3. A static site.

# Tutorial

## 1. Creating the S3 Bucket.

Go to S3 in the AWS Console and create a new bucket.

![Create S3 Bucket](/assets/img/DanielSpyros/s3_createbucket.jpeg)

Give the S3 bucket a name. You should name the bucket as the URL from which you would like to serve the site. I believe this is mandatory to serve the site from an S3 bucket, but it is not mandatory if you connect it to a cloudfront distribution as I will show you in the next tutorial.

Uncheck "Block all public access" and check the acknowledgement.

## 2. Uploading the site to the S3 Bucket.

Upload your site's HTML and assets to the S3 bucket. In my case, I am using Jekyll so I need to make sure Jekyll has compiled the project by running `jekyll serve` and then uploading the contents of the `_site` directory.

![Upload Site](/assets/img/DanielSpyros/s3_bucket_upload.jpg)

Make sure that index.html ends up in the root directory of the bucket instead of a subfolder. I recommend dragging and dropping the files or using the AWS CLI to do this. Using the "Add Folder" button put my files in a `_site` subfolder so I had to remove and readd them.

Once uploaded, it should look something like this:

In a later tutorial, I will show you how to automatically upload to the S3 bucket when we push new changes to the Github repository using Github Actions.

## 3. Configuring the S3 Bucket for Static Website Hosting.

Now go to the properties tab of your S3 bucket.

![S3 Bucket Properties](/assets/img/DanielSpyros/s3_bucket_properties.jpg)

Scroll to the bottom where it shows "Static website hosting" and click "Edit".

![Set S3 Bucket Static Site Hosting](/assets/img/DanielSpyros/s3_bucket_staticsite_edit.jpg)

Enable static website hosting. Leave the hosting type as "Host static website", and set the index and error documents as necessary.

## 4. Setting the Bucket Permissions.

Now go to the Permissions tab and edit the bucket policy.

![S3 Bucket Permissions](/assets/img/DanielSpyros/s3_bucket_permissions.jpg)

Paste in this JSON policy:


```json
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Id": "DanielSpyrosBucketPolicy",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPublicReadAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::www.danielspyros.com/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
Update the `Resource` value to your buckets ARN. Make sure it ends with `/*` to give permission to all objects in the bucket. Also update the Id of the policy - this can be whatever you want, or you can remove it.

Now save the policy.

## 5. Viewing the site from the S3 Bucket URL.

Go to the Properties tab again, scroll to the bottom and find the URL where your bucket is being hosted.

![S3 Bucket Endpoint](/assets/img/DanielSpyros/s3_bucket_endpoint.jpg)

Click the link and view your site.

![Visit Site](/assets/img/DanielSpyros/s3_bucket_endpoint_page.jpg)

Great, it is working. All we need to do now is link it to our custom domain.

## 6. Linking to a custom domain.

Go to the Hosted Zone for your domain on Route53. Create a record.

![Route 53 - Create Record](/assets/img/DanielSpyros/route53_createrecord.jpg)

Configure the alias to point to our S3 bucket.

![Route 53 - Alias to S3 Bucket](/assets/img/DanielSpyros/route53_alias_s3.jpg)

It may take several minutes for this DNS record to propagate across the internet. You can use a site like [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/#A/) to see where in the world your domain resolves to an IP address.

You can check whether you can access the site by running `ping www.danielspyros.com`. If you get this response:
`Ping request could not find host www.danielspyros.com. Please check the name and try again.`, go and make yourself a cup of tea. Once you are refreshed, run `ipconfig /flushdns` and try pinging the site again. You should get something like this:
```
Pinging dev.danielspyros.com [18.165.123.12] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 18.165.123.12: bytes=32 time=9ms TTL=246
Reply from 18.165.123.12: bytes=32 time=6ms TTL=246
Reply from 18.165.123.12: bytes=32 time=6ms TTL=246
Reply from 18.165.123.12: bytes=32 time=51ms TTL=246

Ping statistics for 18.165.123.12:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 6ms, Maximum = 51ms, Average = 18ms
```

Now that the domain is resolving, let's visit the site.

## 7. Viewing the site from your custom domain.

Go to your site. In my case it is at www.danielspyros.com.

![DanielSpyros.com](/assets/img/DanielSpyros/danielspyros.jpg)

Voil√†. It's all working, albeit over HTTP. Although my site is just a blog and HTTP is fine, I don't like that web browsers add a big warning saying "Not Secure". It makes the site look less professional and may put off some users from using the site. 

In the next tutorial, I will show you how to serve the site over HTTPS with a cloudfront distribution. After that, I will show you how to automatically update the site with Github Actions CICD.
