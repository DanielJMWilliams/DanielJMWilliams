Software Engineer with a first-class honours degree in Computer Science from the University of Birmingham and 5 years of professional experience at PwC and Geoff Smith Associates designing and developing secure web applications. Security focussed with an eye for spotting vulnerabilities together with effective communication and team working skills to ensure issues are appropriately remediated.

I am fascinated by languages and have taught myself Spanish to a high level. I am now
learning French, Polish and Greek, all of which I hope to speak well within the next 5 years.
Throughout 2022 I hosted a weekly language exchange meetup in Birmingham where people
from many different places across the world came together to practise their language skills.

Open to roles in software engineering, cyber security or artificial intelligence.
